Here at The Exam  House we strongly believe that public exams Including GCSE and A levels should be as accessible as possible. Along with our partners BYT, we utilise classrooms on the high street to bring examination services to pupils. 

With a strong sense that examinations are a bureaucratic hurdle that are a public good and should be priced proportionally. We have an active Access Pricing plan ensuring those who would not otherwise afford to take exams.

The History of the Exam House: 

Our sister organisation BYT provides private tuition. We came to see a great deal of parents asking us about private candidates for exam sitting in GCSE and A level exams. While we initially partnered with established exam centres we began to research the cost.


Often the most needy of taking exams are those who have either been ill served by school or have a challenge getting to school. The current market for outside of school exam taking is both expensive and prohibitive. So the pupils who cannot take exams in school are punished twice.

Our aim is to rectify this anomaly and serve pupils are not being served by the traditional establishments. Keeping the costs down and where we feel suitable providing scholarships for GCSE and A level exam taking.

 The Exam House has been set up to reach parts of the annual school cohort that the school does not serve with exam sitting opportunities.
